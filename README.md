# Motion-Planning---3-link-manipulator-path-planning-in-C-space

This Matlab script simulates a 3 link revolut joint manipulator robot for motion planning.

The approach is as follows:
1. Construct a rigidbody tree based robot
2. Construct Configuration Space
3. Use A* for path planning
4. Animate the process

How to use?
- You'll need Matlab for running the mlx script.
The mlx notebook is well commented and should help in running the simulation.
